Currently experiencing issues with unicode encoding. 
Need to determine exactly what the scope of unexpected behavior is and probably put it into a try/except block. 
I have the rules for tokenizing mostly defined for english input, but some of the data files are in a completely foreign language. 
For example: grpc_test/sample_data/bhl/ocr/bhl2/00410casxa2200133xxx4500/verhandlungender21gese/
Not sure what to do about any of these files
